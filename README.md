Architecture

There were many different types of development that I used in this full stack project. I learned that the front end of these applications is normally where the users will interact with the application. The back end of an application is where all the behind the scenes modifications happen. The back end uses things like NoSQL MongoDB database because this database is accessed by users through an external application. It stores data that is vital to the user experience. 

Functionality

JSON and JavaScript are both common things that are found in web development. However, they are not quite the same. JSON is a data format that is independent of any programming language. It can be read by JavaScript which makes it easy for JavaScript to take the data and turn it into an object within the JavaScript language. This is also what ties the front ends and back ends together. It creates a way for the data and JavaScript objects to be stored in the back end and retrieved depending on what the front end is asking for. 

Testing

There are a few different methods that I became familiar with through this course. Some of these include GET, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. Each of these methods are used for different things. The GET method is used for retrieving things, PUT is used for updated, DELETE is used for removing things, and PATCH is used for minor modifications. These methods allow new functionality to be added or removed. Alongside of methods there are endpoints. Endpoints are essentially the results of the methods. Security in a full stack application is what prevents unauthorized users from having access to databases and the ability to modify things. 

Reflection

This course has been very helpful with giving me a glimps into what web development looks like. I have considered doing web development professionally for a while and this has help me narrow down the specifics of this particular subject. I have learned a lot about the front ends of a web application and the back end of a web application. I used Express HTML and an Angular project structure. I believe there is still a lot I have yet to learn but I am super excited to futher my knowledge!
